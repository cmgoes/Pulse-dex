# NovaDEX Interface

This is the first version/iteration of NovaDEX, which is a Uniswap fork compatible with Nova Network. This version is open-source and can be used/cloned for development purposes.

### âš  Usage Warning

This is not the current version of NovaDEX, and is not actively maintained. We have left it here to make it easier for developers wanting to deploy a DEX on Nova Network, but we do not support and/or update this source.
